# Desafio Resultados Digitais - Tracking js lib

## How to use
- import cookie.js in your site
- you may want to open cookie.js and change server url

## TODO
- add function to configure server url (having it fixed on code is not cool at all)
- add webpack and unit tests for structure, tests and build purposes
- deploy lib on npm
